A playable game of chess made in Java. The source for the chess rules is mainly [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess).
I wanted to document properly how to play the game to create the program based on that.

Build the project using gradle:
```bash
gradle clean build
```

Checkout for more documentation for the game in [docs](/docs)!
